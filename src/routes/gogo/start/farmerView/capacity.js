          1. Pusa Bin :
          It comes under category of small storage(1.5 to 15 quintals).
    Developed by the Indian  Agricultural Research Institute (I.A.R.I.),having a durability of an year, these silos are made of earth or sun-dried bricks; they are rectangular in shape and have a capacity of   1   to   3   tonnes.   A   typical   "Pusa"   bin   has   a   foundation   of   bricks,   compacted   earth,   or stabilized earth. A polyethylene sheet is laid on this, followed by a concrete slab floor 10 cm thick. An internal wall of the desired height (usually 1.5 to 2 metres) is constructed of bricks or compacted earth, with a sheet of polyethylene wrapped around it. This sheet is heat-sealed  to the basal sheet, and the external wall is then erected. During the construction of the wall an outlet pipe is built into its base. The concrete slab roof is supported by a wooden frame and, like  the  floor,   is  constructed  of   two  layers  separated   by  a  polyethylene  sheet. During  its construction, a man-hole measuring 60 x 60 cm is built into one corner. The "Pusa" bin has been widely adopted in India, and has been demonstrated in some African countries. It gives good results when loaded with well dried grain.

  2. Hapur-Tekka :
  It is a cylindrical rubberised cloth structure supported by bamboo poles on a metal tube base, and has a small hole in the bottom through which grain can be removed.

  3. PAU Bin :
  This is a galvanized metal iron structure. Its capacity ranges from 1.5 to 15 quintals. Designed by Punjab Agricultural University.

  4. Steel-bin :
  Steel bins are improved method as compared to Kuthilas. It is more
    scientific and safe method ofstorage. Steel bins are made up ofsteel sheets turned
    in round shape providing a covered mouth of upper side for filling grain and one
    outlet in bottom to take out the grains. These bins are free from moisture, rodents
    and to some extent pest proof. The capacity of such bins ranges from 5 to 15
    quintals. Due to more scientific method ofstorage, the Government agencies like
    U.P. Agro-Industrial Corporation first supplied these bins to the marginal farmers at
    substidised rate to make it popular.
    This method has following merits:</p>
    <p>
    (i) Steel bins are easy to transport.</p>
    <p>
    (ii) It can be kept at a convenient place in the house.</p>
    <p>
    (iii) This structure is moisture, rodents, birds and to some extent pest proof
    </p>
    <p>
    (iv) Timely inspection, prophylactic and curative treatment can be administered
    whenever required.</p>
    DemeritThis method has following demerit:-<p>
    (i) This method is employed for storing small quantity of wheat. Hence it is not
    suitable for middle as well as big farmers.</p>
    <p>
    (ii) Steel bins are economical still marginal/small fanners cannot purchase these
    bins at subsidised rate.</p>

                CAP :Large scale grain storage is done in CAP and silos. CAP Storage (Cover and Plinth) involves the construction of brick pillars to a height of 14" from the ground, with grooves into which  wooden crates are fixed for the stacking of bags of food grains. The stacks are covered with 250 micron LDPE sheets from the top and all four sides. Food grains such as wheel, maize, gram, paddy, and sorghum are generally stored in CAP (cover and plinth) storage for 6-12 month periods. It  is the most economical storage structure and is being widely used by the FCI   for  bagged   grains.   The   structure  can   be   fabricated  in   less   than   3  weeks.   It   is   an economical way of storage on a large scale (India Agronet, 2009).</p>
    <p>Burkino Silo:Based on a traditional dome shaped type of bin, this silo is constructed  with stabilised earth bricks. Various models and capacities are available. The base is made of stabilised earth resting on the ground or on concrete pillars. The domeshaped roof is also made of  stabilised earth bricks, using  special wooden formers. The  technique  of making a dome-shaped roof is   not  easy to master, and usually has  to   be  done by skilled masons. A variant has been developed with the roof resting upon a wooden frame, which can be erected by unskilled farmers.</p>
    <p>Metal Silo:Economically valid for storing large quantities (over 25 tonnes), metal silos are often regarded as too costly for small scale storage. Nevertheless certain projects have been successful in introducing small metal silos, of 0.4 to 10 tonne capacity, at farm/village level in developing countries: Swaziland (Walker, 1975), and India (Anon, 1982), to mention just a  few.  Metal silos are  reported to  have been used  on farms and in  villages in Guatemala for over 50 years (Breth, 1976) and in Swaziland, on a small scale, for possibly longer.</p>
    <p>Synthetic Silo:Various attempts have been made to develop small scale storage bins, using synthetic   materials   such   as   butyl   rubber   (O'Dowd,   1971)   and   high   density   polyethylene (CFTRI, 1975). However, such bins proved to be either too expensive or prone to damage by pests. Also the management level required by such storage facilities is probably too high for most rural situations.</p>
    <p>USAID Silo:This silo is based on the "Burkino" silo and examples have been erected in  Nigeria;  holding  one  tonne  of   maize   grain,   the   silo   rests   on  stone  or   concrete   pillars supporting a reinforced concrete slab 1.5 metres in diameter. The walls are made of stabilised earth bricks and are plastered inside and out with cement reinforced with chicken wire mesh. The top is domeshaped with a central round opening, and covered with a cone-shaped earthen cap. This is   plastered  with cement, and rests on bamboos or   on  a metallic drum base. An outlet door, consisting of a 15 x 30 cm plate 1.5 mm thick which is smeared with grease for easy sliding, is let into the base concrete slab.
